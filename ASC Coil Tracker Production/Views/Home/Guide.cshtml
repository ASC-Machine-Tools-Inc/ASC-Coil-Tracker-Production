                <h3>Creating a coil</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Navigate to the <strong>Coils</strong> page from the top
                        navigation bar.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Click on the <strong>Create New Coil Record</strong> button in
                        the top left under the navigation bar.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fill out the fields on the left and click the <strong>Create</strong>
                        button at the bottom when you're done.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The fields on the right are not required, but
                                can be used to calculate information for the coil: see the section
                                on the <a href="#coil-calculator">coil calculator</a> for more info.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Deleting a coil</h3>
                <p>
                    Coil records are persistent to keep records of all coils, even ones used up (where
                    the length is 0). To view these depleted coils, see the guide for the
                    <a href="#coil-searching-and-filtering">non-depleted/all filter</a>.
                </p>

                <h3>Editing a coil's information</h3>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            For a given coil, you can edit its information under its <strong>Actions</strong>
                            button by clicking <strong>Edit</strong>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Editing is the same as
                            <a href="#creating-a-coil">creating a coil</a>, as the same fields are still required.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Click on the <strong>Save</strong> button at the bottom of the page to save any changes
                            made to the coil fields.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <h3>Printing a coil's information</h3>
                <p>
                    For a given coil, you can print its information under its <strong>Actions</strong>
                    button by clicking <strong>Print</strong>. Here is an example coil label:
                </p>
                <img src="~/Content/Images/coil_label.jpg" class="img-fluid justify-content-center my-2" />

                <h3>Other coil actions</h3>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Details</strong> will show the information for the coil, also including the
                            <strong>original length</strong> of the coil. On the right, the history records for
                            the coil are also shown.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Add Record</strong> will take you to the creation page for a new history
                            record, for that corresponding coil. For more information on creating history records,
                            see <a href="#creating-a-history-record">creating a history record</a>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>Coil searching and filtering</h3>
                <h4>Non-depleted/all filter</h4>
                <p>
                    By default, only coils with a length greater than 0 or no length are shown.
                    To view the depleted coils:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Navigate to the <strong>Coils</strong> page from the top
                            navigation bar.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Click on the <strong>Show:</strong> dropdown in the top middle under the
                            navigation bar, which has non-depleted coils as its default.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Switching to <strong>All</strong> will show you all coils.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <h4>Sorting</h4>
                <p>
                    By clicking on the <strong>ID</strong> table label, you can sort coil IDs in
                    ascending or descending order.
                </p>

                <h4>Searching</h4>
                <p>
                    In the search bar at the top, you can start typing to automatically filter the
                    table. The default filter is All Fields, meaning all coil fields will look for
                    a match with your search. To search by a specific field, click on All Fields
                    to expand the dropdown and select your desired field to filter on.
                </p>

                <h2>Search History</h2>
                <h3>Creating a history record</h3>
                <p>
                    History records can be created through two options:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Through the <strong>Add Record button</strong> under actions for a coil.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Through the <strong>Details</strong> page for a coil.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    From there, the process is mostly the same as creating coils. Note that the date
                    is required and set to today by default. Additionally, the amount used cannot be
                    greater than the corresponding coil's length.
                </p>

                <h3>History actions</h3>
                <h4>Editing</h4>
                <p>
                    You can edit a history record the same as a coil record. If you change the amount
                    used for a history record, the corresponding coil's length will update to reflect
                    it. History record dates cannot be updated currently, so if you have entered the
                    wrong date delete the record and create a new one.
                </p>
                <h4>Deleting</h4>
                <p>
                    <i>Deletion is final!</i> There is a check to make sure you are sure before deleting.
                    If you delete a history record with a value for amount used, that length will be readded
                    to the coil's length.
                </p>

                <h3>History searching and filtering</h3>
                <p>
                    See <a href="#coil-searching-and-filtering">searching for coils</a>. The main difference is
                    that the default filter here is by coil ID.
                </p>

                <h2>Coil Calculator</h2>
                <p>
                    The coil calculator can be found on its own page in the navigation bar on top and on the
                    pages for creating and editing coils. Values are saved between these, so there's' no need
                    to reenter them. The functionality for this was inspired by the Unravel app.
