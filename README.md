## Setup

Connecting to the database: you'll need the .mdf and .ldf files, which are stored in App_Data.
If you're setting this up remind me to send you a copy of those, as Github won't store them.
This should be for development, as the production database is stored on the network on JOBSHEETSPOCK.

Open the solution file (ASC Coil Tracker Production.sln) and navigate to Views/Coil/Index and hit Ctrl+F5,
which should build the project and show you the database on localhost.

See Phi Ton (<pton@ascmt.com>) for any help with this process.
